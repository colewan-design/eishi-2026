        whyUs: "Why Choose Us?",
        batangasP1: "The poultry farming business, which we started in the fall of 2018, has quickly gained momentum, and we now have four operational poultry farms. The eggs produced using Japanese poultry farming technology have been highly praised, and we are grateful to receive purchase inquiries from all over the Philippines.",
        batangasP2: `We aim to deliver high-quality eggs, produced with Japanese technology, to the people of the Philippines. These eggs, laid by healthy hens raised with great care and dedication, will be brought to the everyday dining tables of the Philippines.`,
        batangasP3: "With this vision in mind, we plan to expand our poultry farms to 10 locations across the Philippines, allowing us to deliver eggs to even more people. In our poultry farm, we enforce strict hygiene management to prevent any contact with wild birds and to ensure that no pathogens are brought into the facilities.",
        batangasP4: "In addition, we conduct daily veterinary inspections to monitor the health of the chickens, and we also disinfect facilities and equipment regularly to prevent infections. The safe and secure eggs produced under these strict conditions contribute to our daily revenue.",
        batangasP5: "Currently, we are planning a large-scale expansion of our poultry farming operations in Rosales, Pangasinan Province. Located approximately 2 hours by highway from the capital, Manila, and just a few kilometers from the Rosales Pangasinan large shopping mall near the Rosales IC, we plan to use a 24-hectare plot of land (equivalent to five Tokyo Domes) as the site for a new poultry farm. This initiative aims to significantly expand egg production. The site is conveniently located near a feed factory in Isabela Province, enabling efficient feed supply. Upon completion of the facility, it is expected to produce 600,000 to 800,000 eggs per day at peak capacity.",
        pangasinanP1: "The Municipality of Balungao is a newly classified first-class municipality on January 1, 2025. The town is bounded with the other first class municipalities of Rosales, Villasis, Tayug, Cuyapo, Umingan and Alcala.",
        pangasinanP2: "Balungao is strategically surrounded by five first-class municipalities where economic activity is thriving and diverse. It is situated 2 kilometers away from the SM Carmen in Pangasinan, which is the commercial hub of all the adjacent first-class municipalities and it is just 1 kilometer away from Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway (TPLEX).",
        pangasinanP3: "Balungao has many wide and open plain lands which are far from the densely populated area and has a temperate climate which make it ideal for agricultural-industrial farming and free range farming.",
        pangasinanP4: "In February 2025, Eishi acquired this massive 24-hectare/240,000-square-meter agricultural land located at the foot of Mount Balungao. It has a diversion dam that receives water from Mount Balungao all year round. It is strategically within 9 kilometers from SM Carmen and 6 kilometers from TPLEX Rosales Exit.",
        pangasinanP5: "Eishi is closely coordinating with its partners to develop the land into a dairy farm for milk production, a poultry farm for egg production, a feed mill for poultry feeds and a free range farm for that will serve provinces of Northern Luzon which lacks the said agricultural industries.",
        whyDairy: "Why Dairy farm?",
        dairyP1: "The Philippines is producing only 1% of its total milk consumption which is about 19,000 metric tons. The rest of the milk consumption which is 99% or about 1,920,000 metric tons are imported. Eishi and its partners envisions to increase the local production of fresh milk in order to reduce the reliance of the Philippines from milk importations.",
        dairyP2: "The nearest dairy farm is the Laoc Dairy Farm which is only 38 kilometers away. The Laoc Dairy Farm is using the native water buffalo, locally named “carabao”, which is merely producing 7.5 liters of milk per day. Carabao as a milking cow is has a low milk production compared to the cattles used in the other countries. This is the main problem for low production of milk in the Philippines.",
        dairyP3: "Eishi is coordinating with the National Dairy Authority (NDA) to avail the aggressive government programs to increase Philippine milk production using Holstein, Jersey, Brown Swiss and Ayrshire cattle breeds. NDA is addressing the milk consumption of the Philippines which will increase up to 2,150,000 metric tons in 2028.",
        whyPoultry: "Why poultry farm?",
        poultryP1: "As Eishi experienced its first egg production at the Egg Basket Capital in San Jose, Batangas, the Tokyo Farm egg production is limited byits land area which is merely 3,500 square meters producing only 19,000 eggs per day. Future expansions will require new land area which is costly as San Jose, Batangas is a commercial hub and densely populated.",
        poultryP2: "Eishi plans to use the 10 hectare or 100,000 square meters as poultry egg production that may yield 600,000 or 800,000 eggs per day at its peak capacity. Eishi is proposing an alternative massive source of eggs in the Northern Luzon which is nearer and fresher rather than the eggs from Bulacan and Batangas provinces which are about 200 kilometers and 300 kilometers away, respectively, from the Northern Luzon provinces.",
        whyFeed: "Why feed mill for poultry feeds?",
        feedP1: "The feed costs can account for a significant portion of around 70-60% of overall poultry egg production expenses, with prices fluctuating based on ingredient availability and market conditions. Eishi realizes the importance of poultry feeds as an indispensable material in poultry farming and plays a crucial factor to the net income of the farm.",
        feedP2: "Eishi is planning with its partners to make its poultry farm as self-sufficient by producing its own poultry feeds through its feed mills. With this, the feed cost will be reduced to 40 to 30% of the overall gross expenses. The raw materials for the poultry feeds is also cheaper as it will be coming from the nearby provinces in the Northern Luzon which is the same source of feeds of the feed mills located in Batangas.",
        whyRange: "Why free range farm?",
        rangeP1: "Eishi and its partners always envision an environmental friendly and natural farming methods reducing harmful chemicals in order to preserve ecosystems, soil health, biodiversity, promote water conservation, climate change mitigation and especially consumer health ensuring that the food produced is healthier for consumers, free from pesticides or synthetic additives.",
